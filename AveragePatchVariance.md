While trying to select human made pictures, a question poped through my mind: How do I actually know they are not generated by AI? I initially searched for pictures done before AI invaded the internet, and landed on a wallpaper site. Cool I thought I have lots of materials, on all the categories I need... JACKPOT... But then the inner QA wanted to be sure... I already know, distinguishing between a good AI generated image and a real one, is a flip of a coin... 

So here comes the rabbit hole! 


AI vs Real photos... Can you tell the difference? I already know I can't so, how do I TEST if a picture is AI or not? After some interesting talks with ChatGpt, I came across the concept of "Average Patch Variance (APV)". How does it work? The algorithm takes an image, splits it into patches of let's say 32 px, and calculates the average of that area. Then does an average for all the patches. It's simple and elegant, mathematical. Probably not fool proof, but as far as I've experimented, it's a decent indicator: if for a patch of 32px the value is below 250 it has a high probability to be AI. 

Now I discussed with ChatGpt and took a photo I generated with his helped in a different conversation, and then tried to analyze it with ChatGPT. I implemented the AVP algorithm, and for a patch of 32 I had 221.51. Now in 3 discussions with ChatGPT, it gave me a value of 718.14 and marked it as real (indicating a threshold of 500), an AVP of 223.96 and marked it as real, 138.68 and marked it as real (indicating a threshold of 100).

Confused? Yeah mee too, at first... 

If we assume that it didn't take the same patch size, and there are some variations on the math (e.g. aproximations and stuff), then 718.14 is the result for a patch of 204 px, 223.96 is the result of a patch of size of 32 and 138.68 for a patch size of 16. As for the treshold, it was probably comparing the value to the treshold of another patch size.

While trying to select human made pictures, a question poped through my mind: How do I actually know they are not generated by AI? I already know, distinguishing between a good AI generated image and a real one, even with my skills, is a flip of a coin.. (50% chances to get it right)

I then stumbled upon the concept of Average Patch Variance, or APV for short. Perhaps I'm beeing geeky, but I love having a math formula to give a hand with some numbers that have a clear interpretation.

How it works 
The APV algorithm looks at your image and slices it up into a bunch of tiny square patches—let’s say 32 pixels by 32 pixels. Like a giant chocolate bar chopped into neat little squares (only way less tasty). Then, it checks how much the pixel values vary inside each square. Think of it like asking: “Hey, is there any texture in this patch? Or is this the digital equivalent of plain tofu?”

Once it goes through all the squares, it averages those little patch variances. Boom: you get the APV value.

Why it matters
Here’s where the magic kicks in: AI images usually have smoother textures and less randomness, so the average variance per patch tends to be lower. Real photos? Messy, full of natural chaos—your pores, your flyaway hairs, the chaos in your background. So they usually have higher APV.

If your APV score is below, 250 for a patch size of 32px? There’s a good chance it’s AI-generated. Above that? Probably a real photo… or a very chaotic AI one that tried too hard.
