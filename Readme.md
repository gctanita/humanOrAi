# Human vs AI

Just how good are we to distinguish between human made art and AI generated one? The only way to test this is to select and generate pictures and see how people respond. 


Structure of this "research": 
- 1 form for each topic
- main topics:
    - portraits
    - landscapes
    - animals
    - food
    - arhitecture
    - interior design
    - objects
    - fantasy or mythological

- for each topic, 3 pictures will be selected from each style (where possible):
    - photorealistic
    - ilustrative - comic / anime / manga
    - CGI - 3d rendered / pixar like / CGI
    - painting: watercolor / oil painting / generic painting 
    

Steps:
- search for human made pictures
    - document the source of the pictures
- generate AI pictures for the category/style 
    - document the prompts they were generated on
    - use art generated in "one shot" prompts each in it's own conversation
- figure out how to collect the information 
    - google forms
